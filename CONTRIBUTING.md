# Contributing to Quint Code

## Workflow

1. **Create an issue first** — Open an issue with the `proposal` label. Include:
   - Rationale — either FPF methodology alignment or UX improvement (feature request)
   - Question or problem statement
   - Proposed solution

2. **Wait for agreement** — Do not create a PR until the proposal has been discussed and agreed upon in the issue.

3. **Check for existing work** — Before starting, verify no one else has picked up the same issue. Comment on the issue to claim it.

4. **Create PR to `dev` branch** — When ready, open a pull request targeting `dev`, not `main`. Link the original issue.

5. **Update the changelog** — Add your changes to `CHANGELOG.md` under the `[Unreleased]` section.

## Want to Help but No Proposal?

Check existing issues labeled `bug`, `documentation`, or `help wanted`. Leave a comment to express interest and wait for approval before starting work.

## Summary

```
